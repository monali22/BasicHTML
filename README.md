# BasicHTML

## In a new index.html file, I have created the basic structure of an HTML document and included the following in it:
   * DOCTYPE declaration
   * Head tag with a title tag
   * H1 tag with a title of your choice
   * Embed an image
   * Create the following three links on your page:
    1. One link that is target="_blank" so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
    2. Make the second link bold.
    3. Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere
   * Create an ordered list 
   * Create an unordered list 
   * Create a table with 2 columns 
   * Embed a Youtube video
